## My process

### What I learned

Most of this task was pretty easy as I've completed a lot of similar tasks as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer course.

CSS is definately my weakest quality as a developer. I'm always struggling to wrangle flexbox and positioning divs on the page, but I usually find my way with the help of [Flexbox Froggy] (https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

This is also my first time writing a README file. Pretty daunting, and I've tried to avoid it for as long as possible. However, the template Frontend Mentor have left is pretty snazzy!

### Continued development

Wow, I really need to brush up on my CSS and HTML structure. Don't worry, I'll be sure to get a lot more practice!

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - My go-to when flexbox is driving me insane. Nice and visual, you can see how each flexbox property affects the document in real time.
